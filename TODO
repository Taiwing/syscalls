--- TODO ---

front:
	- separate the generic tables from the rest and explain what they are
	- add a paragraph about how the source files are preprocessed, basically
	  that as many syscalls are added as possible with the
	  '__ARCH_WANT_<some syscall>' macros and that in case of multiple
	  definitions the default one is chosen, adding that this configuration is
	  not meant to be realistic but to not miss any syscall
	- Maybe add special cases for some architectures, like "powerpc_nospu_32"
	  and "powerpc_nospu_64" which should just be named "powerpc_<32|64>", or
	  "x86_i386" which should really be either "i386" or "x86_32" and "x86_x32"
	  which should just be "x32". The smart thing should be to add the
	  architecture name and the eventual ABIs as separate infos so that the
	  pages can be listed together when need be.
	- Anyway, add info on top of arch pages, arch name, abi if any, number of
	  syscalls, "not implemented" count, "missing" count (do not add "anon" I
	  think, this is not really useful for the end-user and it is in the csv
	  files anyway), and max syscall NR. And maybe a specific little paragraph
	  about the architecture if need be (maybe not, this is too much
	  customization I think).
	- Make the overall home page clearer. Add a little informative section about
	  what are the kernel and syscalls, as well as why this application was
	  necessary.

find_syscalls:
	- continue remaking the find_syscalls script into python

repo:
	- gather every part into one script to rule them all
