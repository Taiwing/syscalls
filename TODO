--- TODO ---

- fix last missing syscall

--- MAYBE ---

front:
	- add a "diff" section to show the changes from last week (maybe literally
	  use the diff command for this)

- fix noparam syscalls (how though ? hardcoding ?)
- add the source file to the csv files so the user can check himself that the
  data is correct
