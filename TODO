--- MAYBE ---

- add a "diff" section to show the changes from last week (maybe literally use
  the diff command for this)
- use this to create an history of changes (that might be useful for debugging)
- Actually maybe use git for this haha (create a csv repo that would be used just
  for this). It would be ignored by the syscalls repo but would provide a useful
  history none the less. Create the "csv" repo when creating the directory. Commit
  if there is any change.

- fix noparam syscalls (how though ? hardcoding ?)
- fix noparam fanotify_mark (handle CONFIG_ARCH_SPLIT_ARG64... not easy)
- add the source file to the csv files so the user can check himself that the
  data is correct
