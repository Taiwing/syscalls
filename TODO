--- TODO ---

front:
	- beautify with css (colorhunt for classy color scheme)
	- add an 'about' section on the home page explaining what this does and how
	  it came to be (linking to the ft_strace project for posterity)

find_syscalls:
	- generate the csv file for the generic interface too (super important!!!)
	- continue remaking the find_syscalls script into python

repo:
	- create README.md file explaining what this is about
	- maybe actually use a Makefile for building the front (would be kinda cool)
	- gather every part into one script to rule them all
	- automate the process of updating the kernel submodule, finding the new
	  syscalls if any (so re-generating the csv files), re-creating the front
	  and rebuilding/restarting the docker compose (maybe even automate some git
	  actions), then add a cronjob on the host machine
