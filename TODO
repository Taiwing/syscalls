--- TODO ---

front:
	- separate the generic tables from the rest and explain what they are
	- Maybe add special cases for some architectures, like "powerpc_nospu_32"
	  and "powerpc_nospu_64" which should just be named "powerpc_<32|64>", or
	  "x86_i386" which should really be either "i386" or "x86_32" and "x86_x32"
	  which should just be "x32". The smart thing should be to add the
	  architecture name and the eventual ABIs as separate infos so that the
	  pages can be listed together when need be.

find_syscalls:
	- continue remaking the find_syscalls script into python

repo:
	- gather every part into one script to rule them all
	- automate the process of updating the kernel submodule, finding the new
	  syscalls if any (so re-generating the csv files), re-creating the front
	  and rebuilding/restarting the docker compose (maybe even automate some git
	  actions), then add a cronjob on the host machine
	- expand README.md file explanations
