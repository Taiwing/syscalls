--- TODO ---

front:
	- add info on top of arch pages, arch name, abi if any, number of syscalls,
	  "not implemented" count, "missing" count (do not add "anon" I think, this
	  is not really useful for the end-user and it is in the csv files anyway),
	  and max syscall NR

find_syscalls:
	- continue remaking the find_syscalls script into python
	- handle syscalls implemented directly in assembly
	- add architectures that are based on the generic ABI and have a specific
	  unistd.h file (with some macros defining which syscall is wanted), like
	  nios2 or csky (basically every directory under arch/ that is not yet
	  listed by the script)

repo:
	- gather every part into one script to rule them all
