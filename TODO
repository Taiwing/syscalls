--- TODO ---

home page:
	- Rework the status description to make it clearer. Simply list the
	  different possible status and add examples or list the cases if they are
	  few.
	- remove references to missing asm syscalls since we have the all now

find_syscalls:
	- add a new status for syscalls like "syscall" and sparc32's "execv" since
	  they are implemented and found but their parameters are missing (not "asm"
	  since "sigreturn" are found by asm but dont actually have parameter so its
	  not a problem) (incomplete ?)

--- MAYBE ---

front:
	- add a "diff" section to show the changes from last week (maybe literally
	  use the diff command for this)

find_syscalls: (actually hard to do...)
	- check every architecture name and add as many special cases as necessary
	- check the new architectures with other lists: arc, arm64, csky, hexagon,
	  loongarch_32, loongarch_64, nios2, openrisc, riscv_32, riscv_64
