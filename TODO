--- TODO ---

front:
	- create index page for the syscall site
	- add an 'about' section on the home page explaining what this does and how
	  it came to be (linking to the ft_strace project for posterity)
	- add the date of the last refresh on the home page (BIG)
	- hide the status, return value and param count with css
	- beautify with css (colorhunt for classy color scheme)
	- gather every part into one script to rule them all

find_syscalls:
	- generate the csv file for the generic interface too (super important!!!)
	- continue remaking the find_syscalls script into python

repo:
	- create README.md file explaining what this is about
