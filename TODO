--- TODO ---

find_syscalls:
	- handle syscalls implemented directly in assembly

--- MAYBE ---

front:
	- add a "diff" section to show the changes from last week (maybe literally
	  use the diff command for this)

find_syscalls: (actually hard to do...)
	- check every architecture name and add as many special cases as necessary
	- check the new architectures with other lists: arc, arm64, csky, hexagon,
	  loongarch_32, loongarch_64, nios2, openrisc, riscv_32, riscv_64
