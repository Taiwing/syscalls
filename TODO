--- TODO ---

find_syscalls:
	- handle syscalls implemented directly in assembly
	- add architectures that are based on the generic ABI and have a specific
	  unistd.h file (with some macros defining which syscall is wanted), like
	  nios2 or csky (basically every directory under arch/ that is not yet
	  listed by the script)
	- check every architecture name and add as many special cases as necessary

update:
	- make it so new files are also added (useful for newly supported
	  architectures)

--- MAYBE ---

front:
	- update the description to mention the fact that the lists are updated
	  once a week (every monday)
	- add a "diff" section to show the changes from last week (maybe literally
	  use the diff command for this)

find_syscalls:
	- continue remaking the find_syscalls script into python

repo:
	- gather every part into one script to rule them all
