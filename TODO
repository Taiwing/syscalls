--- TODO ---

front:
	- separate the generic tables from the rest and explain what they are
	- add a paragraph about how the source files are preprocessed, basically
	  that as many syscalls are added as possible with the
	  '__ARCH_WANT_<some syscall>' macros and that in case of multiple
	  definitions the default one is chosen, adding that this configuration is
	  not meant to be realistic but to not miss any syscall
	- Maybe add special cases for some architectures, like "powerpc_nospu_32"
	  and "powerpc_nospu_64" which should just be named "powerpc_<32|64>", or
	  "x86_i386" which should really be either "i386" or "x86_32" and "x86_x32"
	  which should just be "x32". The smart thing should be to add the
	  architecture name and the eventual ABIs as separate infos so that the
	  pages can be listed together when need be.
	- Anyway, add info on top of arch pages, arch name, abi if any, number of
	  syscalls, "not implemented" count, "missing" count (do not add "anon" I
	  think, this is not really useful for the end-user and it is in the csv
	  files anyway), and max syscall NR. And maybe a specific little paragraph
	  about the architecture if need be (maybe not, this is too much
	  customization I think).
	- actually handle mobile resolutions (do not go over and beyond for it, this
	  is a desktop site really)

find_syscalls:
	- continue remaking the find_syscalls script into python

repo:
	- Maybe add an API this would be cool. Create an api directory, add the app
	  to the - then really useful - compose file, and move csv/ directory out of
	  the front (COPY it in the Dockerfile probably), probably create an other
	  Makefile for the api (or not, maybe read the csv files directly at api
	  start and dynamically create the routes). Add a swagger doc or something
	  so that people know how to use it. Anyway, probably create a main Makefile
	  at the root of the repository to build the front and the api. See what is
	  common to the both of them and maybe get it out of the build/ directory
	  (the rest should be moved the the front/ directory since it should be
	  front-specific).
	- gather every part into one script to rule them all
	- expand README.md file explanations
