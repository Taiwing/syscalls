--- TODO ---

find_syscalls:
	- continue remaking the find_syscalls script into python
	- handle syscalls implemented directly in assembly
	- add architectures that are based on the generic ABI and have a specific
	  unistd.h file (with some macros defining which syscall is wanted), like
	  nios2 or csky (basically every directory under arch/ that is not yet
	  listed by the script)
	- check every architecture name and as many special cases as necessary

repo:
	- gather every part into one script to rule them all
