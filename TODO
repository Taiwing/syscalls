--- TODO ---

- fix last missing syscall

--- MAYBE ---

front:
	- add a "diff" section to show the changes from last week (maybe literally
	  use the diff command for this)

- fix noparam syscalls (how though ? hardcoding ?)
- check every architecture name and add as many special cases as necessary
- check the new architectures with other lists: arc, arm64, csky, hexagon,
  loongarch_32, loongarch_64, nios2, openrisc, riscv_32, riscv_64
- add the source file to the csv files so the user can see check himself that
  the data is correct
