--- TODO ---

find_syscalls:
	- continue remaking the find_syscalls script into python

repo:
	- gather every part into one script to rule them all
	- automate the process of updating the kernel submodule, finding the new
	  syscalls if any (so re-generating the csv files), re-creating the front
	  and rebuilding/restarting the docker compose (maybe even automate some git
	  actions), then add a cronjob on the host machine
	- expand README.md file explanations
